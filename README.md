# Emotion-based-Music-Recommendation-
With the growing consumption of digital music, users are often overwhelmed with choices and struggle to find music that resonates with their current emotional state. Traditional recommendation systems rely heavily on user history, likes, or popularity trends, lacking real-time personalization. As human emotions are dynamic and context-dependent, there is a need for a system that can intelligently recognize a user’s emotion in the moment and suggest music accordingly to enhance user experience and emotional well-being
